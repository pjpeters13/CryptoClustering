                                        Cryptocurrency Clustering Project


Project Overview:

 This project aims to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages over different time frames. By examining the short-term (24h, 7d, 14d), medium-term (30d, 60d), and long-term (200d, 1y) price fluctuations, we aim to identify patterns and categorize cryptocurrencies into distinct clusters. This analysis can help investors understand the volatility and risk associated with each cryptocurrency.

Data Description:

 The dataset comprises three cryptocurrencies, labeled PC1, PC2, and PC3. For each cryptocurrency, we have recorded the percentage change in price over the following time frames:24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.


Results Summary:

 The analysis of the price change percentages yielded the following insights:
PC1 exhibited slight volatility in the short term but showed a consistent increase over the medium to long term, suggesting a stable investment over longer periods.
PC2 showed moderate to significant increases in the short to medium term but displayed a decrease over the past year, indicating potential for short-term gains but uncertainty over the long term.
PC3 displayed mixed results, with short-term volatility, a decrease in the medium term, and a modest increase over the year, suggesting a higher risk but with potential for gains.


Clustering Analysis:

 Based on the price change percentages, the cryptocurrencies were clustered into categories reflecting their volatility and performance over time. The clustering algorithm aimed to group the cryptocurrencies with similar performance patterns, providing a basis for comparative analysis and investment strategy development.

Conclusion:

 The cryptocurrency clustering project provides valuable insights into the performance and volatility of different cryptocurrencies over various time frames. By analyzing price change percentages, investors can make more informed decisions based on the risk and potential return associated with each cryptocurrency.


Future Work:

 Further analysis could incorporate more cryptocurrencies and additional factors such as trading volume and market capitalization to refine the clustering and provide more detailed insights into the cryptocurrency market dynamics.
